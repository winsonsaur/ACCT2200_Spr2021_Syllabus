# Process costing:

## Is raw material counted twice?
- Short answer: __NO__
- There is _one_ raw materials account
- There is _one_ overhead account
- There are multiple _WIP_ accounts and costs are transferred between them when the process is complete
  - Q: "Why do we need to transfer the total cost of goods completed in the work in process inventory to the bottling work in process inventory"
  - A: To avoid bottlenecks (not a pun) in CFA, and slack capacity in bottling
- The number of processes is determined by the manufacturing process

## In our Fetzer Vinyard example:
- RMI holds: grapes, yeast, labels, bottles, corks
- There are two processes
    - CFA
      - During CFA we transfer in yeast and grapes from RMI
      - Then transfer barrels of aged and fermented wine to Bottling
    - Bottling
      - During bottling we transfer in bottles labels and corks from RMI
      - Transfer in costs of the barrels (Called 'transferred in' costs because they are still in process.)
      - Then transfer bottles of wine to FGI

## Tracking costs in WIP:

We use FIFO or Weighted Average to track value of WIP when we have work that is not completed during the period  

- FIFO gives better information, but is harder to calculate
- Weighted Average is easier, but gives _worse_ information
- We choose between the two based on cost/benefit
- As information systems become less expensive we see more FIFO
- _Note: These do not apply to finished goods_

## What about LIFO? (_Last-in-First Out_)

- Harder than Weighted Average
- Worse information than weighted average
- Not allowed under IFRS, soon to be removed from GAAP
- Remember that Tax accounting is separate from MA! So we won't consider tax benefits here.

## Conversion costs:

- $DL + MOH = CC$
- Why do we combine DL with MOH?
- In process manufacturing labor is inherently indirect!
- So we just allocate it to the process.

## Do we use POHR in Process costing?

- __Yes!__
- We use a version of it in _every_ costing method
- In ABC we call it the activity rate
