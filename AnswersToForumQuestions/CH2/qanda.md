# Why do we adjust under/overapplied overhead at the end? (Ch 2)

- _Why don't we adjust cost of goods sold directly?_
  - We didn't know about the cost when we set up POHR
  - We don't actually know which project caused the overhead!
  - Our application of overhead may be wrong for several reasons
- _Why do we do it at the period, rather than product level?_
  - We are simply treating the adjustment as a 'period' rather than 'product' cost.
  - If we think this difference will persist then, in subsequent periods we will adjust POHR to be more representative

- __This process emphasizes accountability for our own internal forecasts. Even good surprises can be bad.__

# How does a T-account work?

## The sides have goofy names (blame the French)
- Left side: Debit
- Right side: Credit

## Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Total Shareholder's Equity

- **TL & SE** accounts increase with **Credits**
- **TA** accounts increase with **Debits**

# "There's a PEARLS method for remembering double entries as well." (Thanks: Yin Hei Joelle)

Debit:

P: Purchases

E: Expenses

A: Assets

Credit:

R: Revenues

L: Liabilities

S: Sales

# What is COGM?

- COGM: The cost of goods manufactured in the period. This is what is transferred from WIP to FG inventory
- COGS: The cost of goods sold during the period. This is what is transferred from FG inventory into the COGS accounts
- COGM=COGS when you sell everything you make in the period.

# How do we pick cost drivers

## Good drivers are:
- Measurable
- Causal
- Simple

- We will do a lot more with picking cost drivers when we get to Activity Based Costing.

## Examples:

- Direct labor
- Machine hours
- Units produced
- Size of job (e.g. square feet cleaned for some cleaning supplies)

# Job order costing vs. Process costing?

- Workshop --> Job order
- Factory --> Process
- Giant products (Airplanes, Ships, Yachts) --> Job Order
- Giant Clients (IBM-City of Rio) --> Job Order

# How to distinguish direct and indirect materials and labor?

- Is it easy (cost effective) to measure how much we used?
- Is there a recipe?
- It the material or labor expensive?

# How to we estimate PHOR?

## Two estimates:

- Total overhead
- Total use of the driver (activity)

## Use the prior period as a starting point then add information about how you think the next period will be different.

- Seasonality (use last month and this month last year)
- Marketing
- New products
- Other trends

- The estimation window (period length) should be determined by when we find out the amounts of our overheads.

# How do we allocate a supervisor's time (DL or IL)

- __Rule of thumb:__ It's always overhead.

- Note: In the US a "general contractor" is a type of license. This means that the person is qualified and bonded for all relevant tasks and can supervise unlicensed workers.  

- She's telling people what to do, not doing it.

- Why? Because she's the BOSS.

# Operations costing ... Wait whaaaaaaat?

## Operations costing: Nothing new.
- Operations costing just allows some departments to use job order costing and others to use process costing.
- As we did in our process costing example we simply transfer the costs between the departments.

# Insurance premiums?

## What if we have a factory and headquarters?
- Insurance on the factory? MOH
- Insurance on headquarters? SG&A

## What if HQ is in the factory?

- How much would you rent the HQ portion for?
- How much would you rent the factory portion for?
- Use that ratio to assign insurance to MOH and SG&A. Could also use sqft.

# What happens if a manufacturer out sources manufacturing?

- If they still design the product and manage the supply chain, then they are still a manufacturer.
  - Example: Apple outsources manufacturing to Foxconn, but actively manages operations at Foxconn, controls the supply chain, and does all the design work.
  - Let's look at [Fenty Beauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenty_Beauty)
- If they only buy and sell completed products they may be a merchandiser.
- What about Coca-Cola?
  - Coca-Cola does two things:
    1. Owns "Coca-Cola" (a recipe and a brand)
    2. Markets Coca-Cola
  - In Hong Kong [_Swire_](https://www.swire.com/en/global/home.php) makes Coca-Cola
